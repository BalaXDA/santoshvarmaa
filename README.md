### üîç QA Philosophy

As a quality advocate, I believe that:

- Quality is everyone's responsibility, not just the QA team's
- Early testing saves time and resources in the long run
- Automation should complement, not replace, manual testing
- Test documentation is crucial for knowledge sharing and process improvement
- Continuous learning is essential to stay updated with the latest testing methodologies
